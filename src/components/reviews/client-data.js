      "My father has dementia and is bedridden, he lives with me. He has been receiving care from LQS Healthcare Services since February 2023. His carers are so kind and caring towards him, he looks forward to their visits. They undertake his personal care in a very respectful and thoughtful manner and maintain his dignity at all times. They spend time chatting and joking with him, they really lift his mood. There is always good communication between his carers and myself. I feel he is in safe hands when they are with him.",

      "I have found the care help exemplary. I now receive help three times a day. The care is wonderful, always cheerful managing cleaning, cooking and washing as well as taking me out for a walk in the wheelchair. The agency is caring and organises a car to help a carer with travelling between clients. The agency keeps in touch with me with review visits and emails.",

      "Care worker was excellent, providing courtesy and care. Punctuality very good if running late we would always receive a phone call. A lot of attention and a calm approach was very reassuring to both my husband and myself after his many months in hospital. This approach ensures that my husband can continue with his recuperation. We are very pleased with the service given by LQS Healthcare Services.",

Always very prompt and very reliable. The service is very well managed, sorted out absolutely every aspect of care needed for my relative, keeping loved ones informed day by day, always happy to take time to explain the care they are providing. I can honestly say life has been made a lot more bearable during this very difficult time due to this fantastic care agency.",

      "LQS Healthcare Sevices has provided perfect care and support as I recover from shoulder replacement surgery. I am a self-hoisting wheelchair user and have needed help in getting dressed and into my wheelchair. The carer is very kind, attentive and patient. He understands what's involved with a spinal cord injury and is keen to take a holistic approach by asking how I've slept, how I'm feeling and whether there are any issues/concerns. I have great confidence in LQS and my carer and that peace of mind is invaluable. Thank you.",
